_Hey! I've created this camping script. You can craft a tent, and fill it with materials like TheForest style. Also a Campfire, and a bed._
_Its pretty optimized (0.038ms on profiler view). If you want to add new stuff, you are free to do it, you can even do a PR. :)_
 
## SHOWCASE
https://streamable.com/sd2xxz

### WHAT YOU CAN DO📋
- You can craft a "skeleton tent", and you will need some materials in order to craft a real Tent. (configurable)
- You can craft a Campfire, turn it on and off.
- You can open and close your Tent.
- You can craft a Bed and sleep on it.
- You can make a hitching post for your horse

### WORK TO-DO📋
- Make the tent stay after server restart. (SQL needed)
- Add more furniture, like chairs, tables, storage, etc...
- Let you upgrade your campfire and cook on it. (With animations, etc..)
- Tell me more ideas! :3
 

You will need **redemrp_notification** and **progressBars**.
You can replace it if you want!

Add this to your server.cfg
```
ensure redemrp_notification
ensure progressBars
ensure bc_camping
```
