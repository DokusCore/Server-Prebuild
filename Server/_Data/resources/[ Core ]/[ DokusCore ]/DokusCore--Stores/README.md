# Plugin Information
This plugin gives you multiple stores all over the map.<br>
You can buy as well as selling your good at the stores. The stores<br>
are working with a stock, if the stock is empty for a certain item, the<br>
shop wound be able you to sell this item. Users can sell their good to the<br>
store as this will fill the store's stock. All items in the store are located<br>
in the database, here you can also define what items can be sold in which shop.<br>

# Future Features:
For the future, players will be able to buy up a shop and become the owner<br>
of it. The owner of the shop will be able to control the stock of the shop, and<br>
he or she will be responsible for making sure the stock stays filled. The shop<br>
owner will also be able to hire employees that can help the owner to fill the<br>
stock. The income of the shop will automatically be split between the owner and<br>
its employees, where of the percentages can be set in the config.
