1: Go to the Config.lua and set Debug to true
3: Create a file called "Zoning.lua" ( WITH CAPITAL )
4: The Zoning_Default.lua holds the template.
5: Enter in data that is asked in the config. ( A YT Video will be made later on how to )
6: Create the zone with our edited version of PolyZones build into DokusCore.
7: Enter in the vectors to the file and set the min/max Z height.

Now restart the plugin and a box will appear when Grid and Poly is set to 1.
You can fine tune your zone until to your likings.
When done:

8: Go to Config.lua and set Debug to false.
9: Restart the plugin. 

The Zoning.lua will now be deleted and the data will be pushed
to the database. After that the plugin will run automatically 
with the newly added zone.

You can still edit your zone when it is in the database!
Just restart the plugin after a database edit.
No need to relog, or restart the server!
