 <b>DokusCore Stables v1.0.1</b> - Horse Stables for DokusCore
</p>

---
# Dependencies
This plugin is depending on the [DokusCore](https://github.com/dokucore) Framework!<br>
Make sure that DokusCore is started before this plugin!

# Server Prebuild:
If you do not want to build your own server you don't have to, we already did all   <br>
the work for you! Download our [Prebuild](https://github.com/DokusCore/Server-Prebuild) server package and you will be setup  <br>
within minutes. You also do not have to worry about dependencies or if the plugins <br>
are started in the right order. Just insert your server artifacts, change the .cfg <br>
and config files to your liking and off you go! For more information on how to <br>
set up a DokusCore server, see the following video: [Installation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlJFFRzWvDE) <br>

# Installation
Simply extract the `DokusCore--Stables` into your `resources` folder, <br>
and start it via `ensure DokusCore--Stables`. Then go to the Modules.lua <br>
file of `DokusCore` itself and at `_Modules = { Stables }` set it to `true`. <br>
If left to `false` the core will create its own character on ID 1 and not the <br>
multi characters plugin.

# Plugin Information
Give your players the ability to buy, sell, manager and ride a horse! <br>
The stables are made to stimulate roleplay as much as possible, this
we go by giving you a whole set of new options to play with. The NPC
will fetch your horse from the back and bring it to you, it will also
store it when asked. The NPC is completely animated to fetch and store
the horse. This plugin is still in development, more will be added in
