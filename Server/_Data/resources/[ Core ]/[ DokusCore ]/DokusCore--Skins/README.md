 <b>DokusCore Skin Creator (v2.1.2) [BETA]</b> -Â A plugin to create your characters skin!.
</p>

---
# Dependencies
This plugin is depending on the [DokusCore](https://github.com/dokucore) Framework!
Make sure that DokusCore is started before this plugin!

---
# Installation
Simply extract the `DokusCore--Skins` into your `resources` folder, <br>
and start it via `ensure DokusCore--Skins`. Then go to the Modules.lua <br>
file of `DokusCore` itself and at `_Modules = { Skins }` set it to `true`.
If left to `false` the core will create its own character on ID 1 and not the
multi characters plugin

# Server Prebuild:
If you do not want to build your own server you don't have to, we already did all   <br>
the work for you! Download our [Prebuild](https://github.com/DokusCore/Server-Prebuild) server package and you will be setup  <br>
within minutes. You also do not have to worry about dependencies or if the plugins <br>
are started in the right order. Just insert your server artifacts, change the .cfg <br>
and config files to your liking and off you go! For more information on how to <br>
set up a DokusCore server, see the following video: [Installation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlJFFRzWvDE) <br>
