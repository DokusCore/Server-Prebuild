# Dependencies
This plugin is depending on the [DokusCore](https://github.com/dokucore) Framework!<br>
Make sure that DokusCore is started before this plugin!

# Server Prebuild:
If you do not want to build your own server you don't have to, we already did all   <br>
the work for you! Download our [Prebuild](https://github.com/DokusCore/Server-Prebuild) server package and you will be setup  <br>
within minutes. You also do not have to worry about dependencies or if the plugins <br>
are started in the right order. Just insert your server artifacts, change the .cfg <br>
and config files to your liking and off you go! For more information on how to <br>
set up a DokusCore server, see the following video: [Installation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlJFFRzWvDE) <br>
