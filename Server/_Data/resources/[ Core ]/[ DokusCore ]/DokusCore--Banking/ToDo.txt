# When a user makes a deposit or withdraw, set all banks Sync data to false. This
  indicates that the banks needs to be synced again by players doing their jobs
  delivering the promises and bonds from other banks.

# When banks are synced, players are able to withdraw their money from this bank,
  even tough, they have not deposited money into this bank. The banks between each
  others communicate via the player / NPC jobs. Bank 1 pays up to bank nr 2 when a
  player withdraws from a different location.

# The players need to pay a small deposit, withdraw and transaction fee when
  interacting with the bank. This partially will be the payments for those
  syncing up the banks between each other.

# Players are able to deposit in bank nr 1, then wait for bank nr 2 to sync up.
  Withdraw from bank nr 2 and 1 asap, and duplicate their money. However, the user
  will automatically receive a telegram about dept you have at the bank. If the
  player does not return the money he/she owns to the bank, the bank files a warrant
  for your arrest. Depending on the amount of money that was scammed from the bank
  this could also result in a bounty ( Dead or Alive ). Either way you will be
  send to jail. Within the jail you're doing jobs and tasks and this earns your bits
  of money, that will be used to pay of your dept. Once your dept is repaid, you're
  prison sentence ends as long you finished your minimum amount of sentence.

# rewrite how transactions are made. Now they are made for 1 bank account only
  without syncing in mind. A new API has to be made for this data handling.
  2 things need to happen.
  - On Deposit or Withdraw we need to include looking for the bank location
  - On Deposit or Withdraw we need to reset the sync meta string. All banks
    synced go back to false.
