 <b>DokusCore Spawning System (v1.1.1)</b> -Â Spawn, Respawn, and even more respawning.
</p>

---
# Dependencies
This plugin is depending on the [DokusCore](https://github.com/dokucore) Framework!
Make sure that DokusCore is started before this plugin!

---
# Automated Update Checks
This plugin automatically checks if there is a new version available
upon server start. If a new version is available, you will see the plugin
name in red with the new version number behind it. You can also initiate
a full plugin check via the console command `DokusCore Update`

---
# Installation
Simply extract the `DokusCore--Spawner` into your `resources` folder, <br>
and start it via `ensure DokusCore--Spawner`. Then go to the Modules.lua <br>
file of `DokusCore` itself and at `_Modules = { Spawner }` set it to `true`.
If left to `false` the core will create its own character on ID 1 and not the
multi characters plugin

---
# Plugin Information
This plugin spawns your character to the map from the skin or
character creator. This plugin also will handle the respawn and
death status ( future update! ). This is also the plugin that will
save your progress to the database upon logging out. The spawner
plugin gives new characters a cutscene that can be disabled in the
config. It also will give the user music to listen to whilst in the
cutscene, also this can be configured in the config.
