 <b>DokusCore DataSync (v1.4.0) [BETA]</b> -Â Keeps all plugins and the core synced, even when restarted!.
</p>

---
# Dependencies
This plugin is depending on the [DokusCore](https://github.com/dokucore) Framework!
Make sure that DokusCore is started before this plugin!

# Server Prebuild:
If you do not want to build your own server you don't have to, we already did all   <br>
the work for you! Download our [Prebuild](https://github.com/DokusCore/Server-Prebuild) server package and you will be setup  <br>
within minutes. You also do not have to worry about dependencies or if the plugins <br>
are started in the right order. Just insert your server artifacts, change the .cfg <br>
and config files to your liking and off you go! For more information on how to <br>
set up a DokusCore server, see the following video: [Installation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlJFFRzWvDE) <br>

# Installation
Simply extract the `DokusCore--DataSync` into your `resources` folder, <br>
and start it via `ensure DokusCore--DataSync`. Then go to the Modules.lua <br>
file of `DokusCore` itself and at `_Modules = { DataSync }` set it to `true`. <br>
If left to `false` the core will create its own character on ID 1 and not the <br>
multi characters plugin.

# Plugin Information
This plugin stores all the players, plugin and core information so that it is not <br>
lost when a plugin is restarted. Once one of our plugins is restarted on a running <br>
server, they all will contact the DataSync to Sync up again. You can even restart <br>
the core framework itself, it will not break your server due to this plugin. <br>
Note: It is not advised to restart the DataSync plugin on a running server. if <br>
this plugin is restarted, it will lose all player data and plugins will stop working! <br>
