 <b>DokusCore Metabolism (v1.3.3) BETA</b> -Â Controls your players vitals.
</p>

---
# Dependencies
This plugin is depending on the [DokusCore](https://github.com/dokucore) Framework!
Make sure that DokusCore is started before this plugin!

---
# Installation
Simply extract the `DokusCore--Metabolism` into your `resources` folder, <br>
and start it via `ensure DokusCore--Metabolism`. Then go to the Modules.lua <br>
file of `DokusCore` itself and at `_Modules = { Metabolism }` set it to `true`.
If left to `false` the core will create its own character on ID 1 and not the
multi characters plugin

# Server Prebuild:

the work for you! Download our [Prebuild](https://github.com/DokusCore/Server-Prebuild) server package and you will be setup  <br>
within minutes. You also do not have to worry about dependencies or if the plugins <br>
are started in the right order. Just insert your server artifacts, change the .cfg <br>
and config files to your liking and off you go! For more information on how to <br>
set up a DokusCore server, see the following video: [Installation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlJFFRzWvDE) <br>

# Plugin Information
This plugin controls the vitals of the characters in game, the vitals it keeps <br>
track of is Health, Stamina, Thirst and Hunger. This plugin will take the <br>
environment in mind, meaning the temperature effects your hunger and thirst drain. <br>
If you are in a cold area, you use more food than water to keep your body warm. <br>
If you are in a hot area, your thirst will drain faster than your food. <br>
Furthermore, this plugin looks at what you are doing with your character, standing <br>
idle will drain the least, walking drains a little more, running will drain <br>
your vitals significantly more, and sprinting is an impact on your vitals. <br>
All settings for drainage, temperate, and movement parameters can be changed <br>
in the config.
