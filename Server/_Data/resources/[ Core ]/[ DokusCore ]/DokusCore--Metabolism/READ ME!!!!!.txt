Currently you have 2 options that everyone can do until we have the option to
eat and drink. These following options you can use.

/gold [nr] = to activate your golden status, number is in seconds.


WARNING: This plugin is Currently not multiplayer ready, meaning it can result
in strange things when with more then 1 player on the server. This is due how to
data is stored in the server side files. I am in the process of storing all these
values directly into DokusCore, or we will build a plugin that will specifically
hold all users data, so that all plugins can reset and resync.

NOTE: In the coming days I will finish this plugin so that the server side data
is stored correctly!! This will be called DokusSync and will keep all plugins data
up to date. With this you can restart all plugins without any issues as all data
for all plugins will be located on DokusSync, and therefore not lost.
