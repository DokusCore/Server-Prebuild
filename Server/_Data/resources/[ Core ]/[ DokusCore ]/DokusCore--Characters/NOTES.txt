NOTE: This plugin needs extensive testing!
------------------------------------------
This plugin is quite extensive using the in game cameras to give you more of an
immersive experience, this also brings a lot of complexity what can introduce
bugs that I've not found. May you find anything that is not right, please report
back to us in our Discord https://discord.io/dokuscore

NOTE: You can logout and switch to a character you already have made, currently
you're unable logout to create a new character. This has to do with an issue
with the skins plugin, more information in the NOTES file of the skin creator.
We are investigating the issue and release a patch in a later version.

BUG: When logging out back to the campsite, sometimes the menu will not show
all 3 character slots ( this only happens when they are empty ). You will see
all your made characters, but not always al empty slots. We are investigating
the issue and release a patch soon.
