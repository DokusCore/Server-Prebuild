# Bug Fixed: Added in a item amount check when dropping items on the ground.
  You are not able anymore to drop more items on the ground then you
  have in your inventory. Thanks to Red Harlow for reporting this bug

# Bug fixed: When ever you select an item, and give it a larger drop amount then
  you have in your inventory. The item will go to a minus value. This would conclude
  that your inventory would not open anymore until the plugin is restarted. This
  bug is now fixed.

# Added extra notification for when the amount parameter box is empty
