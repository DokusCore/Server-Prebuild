 <b>DokusCore Inventory (v2.1.1) [BETA]</b> - A Inventory system for DokusCore!.
</p>

---
# Dependencies
This plugin is depending on the [DokusCore](https://github.com/dokucore) Framework!
Make sure that DokusCore is started before this plugin!

---
# Installation
Simply extract the `DokusCore--Inventory` into your `resources` folder, <br>
and start it via `ensure DokusCore--Inventory`. Then go to the Modules.lua <br>
file of `DokusCore` itself and at `_Modules = { Inventory }` set it to `true`. <br>
If left to `false` the core will create its own character on ID 1 and not the <br>
multi characters plugin.

# Plugin Information
This plugin provides your users with a Inventory system. You are able to <br>
drop, use, give and split your items in the inventory (Some features are in the works). <br>
The user can select how many items to use or drop a the same time. If the user <br>
drags the item out of the inventory window, then the whole stack will be dropped. <br>
If items are dropped a box will be created right in front of the player, if the <br>
player drops multiple items, these will be inserted to the same box. Boxes dropped <br>
on the ground will persist, even if the server restarts. All drops are stored in the <br>
database, and restored upon plugin/server restart. So you can safely drop your <br>
items or loot and come back later or tomorrow to retrieve them! <br>
