# Dependencies

Make sure that DokusCore is started before this plugin!

# Server Prebuild:
If you do not want to build your own server you don't have to, we already did all   <br>
the work for you! Download our [Prebuild](https://github.com/DokusCore/Server-Prebuild) server package and you will be setup  <br>
within minutes. You also do not have to worry about dependencies or if the plugins <br>
are started in the right order. Just insert your server artifacts, change the .cfg <br>
and config files to your liking and off you go! For more information on how to <br>
set up a DokusCore server, see the following video: [Installation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlJFFRzWvDE) <br>

# Installation
Simply extract the `DokusCore--UsableItems` into your `resources` folder, <br>
and start it via `ensure DokusCore--UsableItems`. Then go to the Modules.lua <br>
file of `DokusCore` itself and at `_Modules = { UsableItems }` set it to `true`. <br>
If left to `false` the core will create its own character on ID 1 and not the <br>
multi characters plugin.

# Plugin Information
With this plugin you can make items usable, this can be consumables, <br>
but also things like placing a tent or campfire. The Usable Item's plugin <br>
will also take care of the player's metabolism if you eat or drink something, <br>
your vital stats will be adjusted. The same goes for placing objects and using <br>
tools, this costs you stamina but also thirst and hunger. In the database you <br>
can set your own animations for each item with this you get true <br>
customizability on how you want your animations to behave. <br>
