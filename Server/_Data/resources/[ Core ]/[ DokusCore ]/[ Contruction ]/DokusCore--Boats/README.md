# Dependencies
This plugin is depending on the [DokusCore](https://github.com/dokucore) Framework!
Make sure that DokusCore is started before this plugin!

---
# Installation
Simply extract the `DokusCore--Boats` into your `resources` folder, <br>
and start it via `ensure DokusCore--Boats`. Then go to the Config.lua <br>
file of `DokusCore` itself and at `_Modules = { Boats }` set it to `true`.
If left to `false` the core will create its own character on ID 1 and not the
multi characters plugin
