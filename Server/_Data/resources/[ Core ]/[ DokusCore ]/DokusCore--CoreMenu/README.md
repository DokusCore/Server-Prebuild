 <b>DokusCore Core Menu (v2.4.0) [BETA]</b> - A Players Settings System for DokusCore!.
</p>

---
# Dependencies
This plugin is depending on the [DokusCore](https://github.com/dokucore) Framework!
Make sure that DokusCore is started before this plugin!

---
# Installation
Simply extract the `DokusCore--CoreMenu` into your `resources` folder, <br>
and start it via `ensure DokusCore--CoreMenu`. Then go to the Modules.lua <br>
file of `DokusCore` itself and at `_Modules = { CoreMenu }` set it to `true`. <br>
If left to `false` the core will create its own character on ID 1 and not the <br>
multi characters plugin.
